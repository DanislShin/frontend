Due to the parent-teacher conferences that will be held on that day, school will end one hour earlier than usual. You’ll still take the same classes that you normally would on that day. The starting and ending bells will ring according to the reduced class time schedule. Once again, please keep in mind that next Tuesday’s class periods will be shortened by 10 minutes each. Thank you.",

Man: I think drama camp is helpful for gaining diverse perspectives. Woman: How will the camp help her with that? Man: In the camp, she’ll play different types of characters. This can help her seethings from others’ perspectives. Woman: That makes sense. Man: Also, she’ll be expected to listen to other kids while collaborating with them. Woman: Oh, that could help her broaden her views. Man: Right. So, participating in drama camp is helpful for obtaining various perspectives. Woman: Okay. Then let’s suggest it to her.",

If so, here’s a simple tip for understanding artists’ work better. Knowing about the artists can deepen your appreciation of their work. Art is often a reflection of their feelings and thoughts. Therefore, by exploring their lives and experiences, you can see what influenced their work. So, the next time you go to an art museum, why not explore the artists’ backgrounds first? Once you know about the artists, you’ll be able to have a better understanding of their work. I hope this helps.",

I was selling some of my old stuff at the flea market. Oh, I like the crown-shaped balloon the girl is holding. She’s my daughter. Hey, do you remember that stripe-patterned tent? Of course. That’s the one I gave you. Oh, there are three vases on the table. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to sell them. I guess people weren’t interested in them. Yeah. People were more interested in the speaker on the chair even though it wasn’t for sale. I turned on music to attract customers. I see. Looks like you had a busy weekend.",

The fair itself will be held all day next Wednesday in the gym. However, to accommodate the setup, the gym will be closed starting Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, all PE classes scheduled for Tuesday periods 5, 6, and 7 will be relocated to the outdoor field. Students in those classes, please check the online portal for your updated room assignment. Remember, the science fair opening ceremony begins promptly at 9:15 a.m. on Wednesday, and all homeroom classes will report directly to the gym at 9:00 a.m. instead of their regular classrooms.
