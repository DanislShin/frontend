          "question": "Dear Rosydale City Marathon Racers, We are really grateful to all of you who have signed up for the 10th Rosydale City Marathon that was scheduled for this coming Saturday at 10 a.m.Unfortunately, as you may already know, the weather forecast says that there is going to be a downpour throughout the race day. We truly hoped that the race would go smoothly. However, it is likely that the heavy rain will make the roads too slippery and dangerous for the racers to run safely. As a result, we have decided to cancel the race. We hope you understand and we promise to hold another race in the near future. Sincerely, Martha Kingsley Race Manager",

          "question": "It was Valentine’s Day on Friday and Peter was certain that his wife, Amy, was going to love his surprise. Peter had spent a long time searching online for an event that would be a new way to spend time with Amy. He had finally found the perfect thing for her. She often told him that she liked to go to places she had never visited before, and he was absolutely sure that she would love going to the new, five-star restaurant downtown. He smiled as he called the restaurant and asked for a reservation for Friday. Unfortunately, his smile quickly disappeared when he was told that the restaurant was fully reserved. “That’s too bad,” he said quietly. “I thought that I had found the right place.”",
